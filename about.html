          <header><h1>About Me</h1>
                </header>
                <p>My name is Jeraldin and welcome to my website!! I grew up in Westchester and have always loved being able to admire the city life&nbsp; as well as the suburan&nbsp; areas. Admiring scenery and being outdoors has always been one of my favorite hobbies which is how I developed a love for photopgrahy.&nbsp;Photopraphy is my way of being able to treasure those speical moments that I wish I could go back to. I also love to film videos but enjoy photography even more. I will admitt that I enjoy scenery photography more than portrait photography becuase it feels more personal when I am photographing alone ina . beautiful place.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                
            
                <h2>College Life&nbsp;</h2>
                <p>I am a sophomore in college and am currently in the process of getting my bachelor's degree in interactive digital media and marketing. I am learning how to use adobe software applications which will allow me to improve my editing and software skills. Many have asked me why I didn't pursue a photography career and this is becuase I didn't want photography to turn into homework and to lose my passion for it. Although many consider it a job I truly enjoy taking photographs. I have found the coursework in this career to be useful towards my photogrpahy editing skills and hope that at the end I will have improve in my skills.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
               
	<h3>Fun Facts</h3>
           <p> In my free time I also enjoy reading fiction romance as a way of destress. Although I dont read as much as I'd like to, I always have a book handy. I still have the first camera that I started with which is a Nikon Coolpix. I also really enjoy painting on my free time, although I am not super talented at it, it helps me clear my mind.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
